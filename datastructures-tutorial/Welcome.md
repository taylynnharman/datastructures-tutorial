# Welcome to TayLynn Harman's Data Structure Tutorial

Every programmer should have an understanding of a few datastructures. Listed in the Table of Contents are 3 of the most fundamental.

## Table of Contents
### Stacks
- [Stacks Module](Stacks/Stacks.md)
- [Stacks Demo](Stacks/StacksDemo.cs)
- [Stacks Exercise](Stacks/Stacks.cs)
- [Stacks Exercise Solution](Stacks/Solution.cs)
### Sets
- [Sets Module](Sets/Sets.md)
- [Sets Demo](Sets/SetsDemo.cs)
- [Sets Exercise](Sets/Sets.cs)
- [Sets Exercise Solution](Sets/Solution.cs)
### Trees
- [Trees Module](Trees/Trees.md)
- [Trees Demo](Trees/TreesDemo.cs)
- [Trees Exercise](Trees/Trees.cs)
- [Trees Exercise Solution](Trees/Solution.cs)

## Getting Started

Each data structure has its own module. Each module will contain C# code, diagrams, and tables to thoroughly cover the data structure. At the end of the module you will find an example problem and an exercise to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.

### Prerequisites

It is expected that students using this tutorial already know how to program in C#.

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (or an alternative C# IDE such as Rider)
- .NET SDK (7.0)
